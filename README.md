# Express.js Weekend Advisor

This Express.js application provides advice based on whether it's a weekday or the weekend.

## Description

This application utilizes Express.js to create a simple server that responds to requests on the root URL ("/") with advice tailored to the current day of the week. If it's a weekday, the advice encourages hard work, while if it's the weekend, the advice suggests having fun.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using npm:

   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server by running:
   ```

   ```
2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the advice for the current day.

## Testing
